### Programming for robots and manipulators

**Course aims:** The goal of the subject Programming of robots and manipulators is to introduce students to modern approaches to robotic technology with focus on programming including solving kinematics/dynamics, optimization of movement, Industry 4.0 and utilization of artificial intelligence. Lecturer of this course (2021): [Ing. Roman Parak](https://github.com/rparak).

* Presentation - Presentation about collaborative robotics, ROS and some interesting points [[czech lang.]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_language). 
* Seminar_paper - Seminar paper, which describe problematic of robots for medicine [czech lang.].
* Project_1 - **ABB RobotStudio - Sorting production line** <br /> This project contain [ABB Robotstudio](https://new.abb.com/products/robotics/en/robotstudio) pack-go file with programed robotic sorting production line in pro. lang. RAPID. Project contain 2 robots in defined template from lecturer with small configurations. The main goal of project was to program functional product sorting machine. According to project assigned, robots use for communication conveyor.

* Project_2 - **Visual Components - Test laboratory cell** <br />This semestral team project is focused on simulation test laboratory cell. In this folder you can find [Visual Components](https://www.visualcomponents.com) .vcmx file, with presenation of work [czech lang.]. Project is programmed in python and simple VC programming interface.
