This repository is used to submit assigned projects from the VRM course. Course is focused on practical and theoretical knowledge in robotics branch. Lecturer of this course is [Ing. Roman Parak](https://github.com/rparak).

* Presentation - Presentation about collaborative robotics, ROS and some interesting points. 
* Seminar_paper - Seminar paper, which describe problematic of robots for medicine [[czech lang.]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_language).
* Project_1 - **ABB RobotStudio - Sorting production line** <br /> This project contain [ABB Robotstudio](https://new.abb.com/products/robotics/en/robotstudio) pack-go file with programed robotic sorting production line in pro. lang. RAPID. Project contain 2 robots in defined template from lecturer with small configurations. The main goal of project was to program functional product sorting machine. According to project assigned, robots use for communication conveyor.
* Project_2 - **Visual Components - Test laboratory cell** This semestral team project is focused on simulation test laboratory cell. In this folder you can find [Visual Components](https://www.visualcomponents.com) .vcmx file, with video and presenation of work. Project is programmed in python and simple VC programming interface.
